After clicking the “creating a new file” link you’ll be taken to the file creation dialog. 
Here, you’ll be facing a blank input field where one typically types the name of the new file being created.
Type the desired name of your new folder followed by a forward slash. 
After the forward-slash character is detected, Github will automatically generate a new input field for the file, 
while recognizing the first input as a new folder name.
